\section*{\tab \tab \tab Refactoring Architecture}
\tab The idea of satisfactory architecture emerging from refactoring sprouts
from the use of AGILE development practices. AGILE is one of the most 
common software development practices and is used widly throughout the 
tech industry. I am going to discuss the downfalls to producing software
through constant refactoring and how it can fail a projects needs.

%=====Q1=====%
\tab Satisfactory architecture emerging from refactoring is a large debate
in the sofwtare architecture community. The idea is that a project can be develped 
without a traditional architecutre through refactoring and editing code. This 
claim is what AGILE development depends on. This ideology allows engineers
to disregard the future of the projects architecture on the basis of refactoring
any issues in the future. 

% EXAMPLES Q2
\tab The architecture developed from refactoring is loose. "Failure 
[architecture did not emerge] is also more prevalent in cases of    
large    pre-existing    products    which    either    had    no    
discernable   architecture   to   begin   with   or   had   their   
architecture  erode  away  over  years  of  maintenance  and  haphazard  
addition  of  new  features  by  persons  who  didn't  understand the 
pre-existing architecture or ignored it for one reason or another"

%=====Q3=======% TALK ABOUT CULTURE
\tab One way to look at AGILE strategies is that it is a development pattern 
whos organization and structure is based on its lack of structure. This makes 
it unlikely for an architecture to be made through refactoring. Refactoring 
doesn't allow a structure since it is a strategy based on the in-the-moment
development. Thapparambil stated "no agile methods discuss Architecture in 
any length".

%=====Q5=====% 201 under Culture
\tab Since there is not a set architecture in a refactoring based development
it is neccesary that new changes are communicated. "They  [the  team]  were  
used  to  work  heads  down  in  their cubicles for months without speaking to
 anybody. After that time they simply deposit hundreds of pages of  
 useless diagrams and felt good about it. [...] the sense 
 of responsibility that comes with Agile is not there
